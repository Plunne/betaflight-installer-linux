# betaflight-installer-linux
Hi! This is a script to install Betaflight on Linux.

# Installation

1. Clone this repo.
    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/Plunne/betaflight-installer-linux.git
    cd betaflight-installer-linux
    ```

2. Run the shell script betaflight_installer.sh
    ```shell
    ./betaflight_installer.sh
    ```

3. During the script you'll have to type the port of your drone. After that, at every launch of BF, a terminal will ask you to enter your sudo password. It's for setting up the permissions of working on the port of your drone.

4. A ".desktop" is now created, you can launch BF from any launcher.

5. Enjoy!
